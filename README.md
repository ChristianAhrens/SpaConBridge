# SoundscapeApp

SoundscapeApp is a project based on d&b audiotechnik GmbH & Co. KG's Soundscape Plugin made publicly available at https://github.com/dbaudio-soundscape/db-Soundscape-DAW-Plugins .

The intention is to create a cross platform app that feels similar to the DAW plugin but can be run and used standalone, maybe with some additional automation and control protocol bridgin features.
