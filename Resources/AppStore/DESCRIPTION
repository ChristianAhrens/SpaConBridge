SpaConBridge is a PRIVATE project inspired by d&b audiotechnik GmbH & Co. KG's "Soundscape DAW Plugin" made publicly available at https://github.com/dbaudio-soundscape/db-Soundscape-DAW-Plugins and d&b audiotechnik GmbH & Co. KG's "Soundscape Control with DiGiCo SD consoles" made publicly available at https://github.com/dbaudio-soundscape/db-Soundscape-control-with-DiGiCo-SD-Consoles.
This project is neither supported, maintained or initiated by d&b audiotechnik and and entirely unofficial open source project.

The idea is to have a user interface that allows viewing and editing of Sound Object parameters of a d&b audiotechnik Soundscape system based on DS100 signal bridge, while also integrating the capability of third party control translation to d&b audiotechnik OSC protocol to externally control Sound Object parameters.

Features

- Monitoring of Soundscape Sound Object parameters
- Protocol bridging from 3rd party devices/applications to d&b DS100 signal bridge
- Monitoring of protocol bridging performance in graphical and textual representation
- Tab based user interface containing tabs for
-- Active Sound Objects in tabular form with dedicated controls for an object's parameters following table selection
-- Comprehensive two dimensional slider surface for viewing and controlling of all active Sound Objects
-- Bridging traffic logging and plotting for active bridging protocols
-- Application settings
