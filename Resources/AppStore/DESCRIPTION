SpaConBridge was created with the idea in mind to have both a simple ui to monitor or control Sound Object parameters of a d&b audiotechnik Soundscape system, esp. the DS100 Signal Engine, via OSC protocol and at the same time the possibility of controlling interfacing with external control data input (MIDI device, OSC control app, ...).

It is neither suppported nor driven by official d&b activities.

It was originally inspired by "Soundscape DAW Plugin" made publicly available at https://github.com/dbaudio-soundscape/db-Soundscape-DAW-Plugins and "Soundscape Control with DiGiCo SD consoles" made publicly available at https://github.com/dbaudio-soundscape/db-Soundscape-control-with-DiGiCo-SD-Consoles.
